# Simon_Says_Game

Summary: This project is a very simple version of Simon Says. 4 Colored squares flash on the screen in a pattern, which increases in length as the game continues. The player must then press the squares in the order that they were flashed. The game ends once the player messes up the pattern and restarts after 5 seconds. 

Potential Future Improvements: Sound effects and a feature that saves the top score. 

Use: This project was created as the final project for a programming class
